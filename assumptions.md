# URL Hashing System - Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions made during the development of the URL Hashing System. It is essential to have a clear understanding of these assumptions to ensure proper functioning and meet user expectations.

## Assumptions

1. **Unique URLs:**
   - The system assumes that each long URL provided by users is unique. Duplicate long URLs may result in unexpected behavior.

2. **JWT Token Validity:**
   - JWT tokens used for user authentication are assumed to be valid and not expired. Proper token management is expected for secure interactions.

3. **Scalability:**
   - The system assumes a moderate level of scalability. While efforts have been made for efficiency, extensive load testing is necessary for high-scale scenarios.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - It is assumed that users take necessary precautions to secure their accounts, such as using strong passwords. The system does not guarantee the security of user accounts if proper precautions are not taken.

5. **Data Privacy:**
   - Users are responsible for the content of the URLs they shorten. The system assumes that users will not misuse the service for illegal or unethical purposes. Data privacy of users is subject to the laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdiction.

6. **Third-Party Libraries:**
   - The system relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. It is assumed that these libraries are secure and maintained by their respective developers.

7. **User Input Validation:**
   - It is assumed that users provide valid input when interacting with the system. Proper validation is in place, but malicious or incorrect input may lead to unexpected behavior.

8. **Maintenance and Updates:**
   - The system assumes regular maintenance and updates to address security vulnerabilities, bugs, or changes in dependencies. Users are encouraged to keep the system up to date.

9. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - The system is assumed to be compatible with modern web browsers. Compatibility with outdated or less common browsers is not guaranteed.

10. **Performance Expectations:**
    - Performance expectations are based on typical usage scenarios. Extreme or unrealistic usage may impact system performance.

## Acknowledgments

These assumptions guide the development and usage of the URL Hashing System. Users and developers should be aware of these assumptions to ensure a smooth and secure experience.
